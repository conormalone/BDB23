get in play probability of a sack/pressure, find the best teams at reducing that in play

to do:
get all pass rushers, passer and blockers for all plays
divide plays into test-train 75:25

prepare graph where distance is edge, qb, OL, DL are node-types, binary pressure is graph feat
train


Visuals
time series of how team's sack risk changes per frame, hopefully showing some teams that reduce
